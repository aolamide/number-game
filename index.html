        Dead and wounded is a game where you have to logically guess a random 4
        digit secret number generated by the computer at the beginning of the
        game. The 4-digit number is formed from 0 to 9 with each digit appearing
        only once and the first digit not being "0". Make a guess to get
        started.

        <h2 class="h2">Winning The Game:</h2>
        After you make a guess, the computer tells you how many of the numbers
        are dead(on the exact position) but doesn't tell you which of them is
        exactly and also tells you how many are wounded(in the set but not on
        the exact position). Using the information given back to you from the
        computer, you must logically guess (kill) the number in few moves as
        possible.

          Example:
          <ul id="example-list">
            <li>Secret number: 1234</li>
            <li>Your try: 4271</li>
            <li>
              Answer: 1 dead and 2 wounded.
              <em
                >2 is on the exact position so it's dead, while both 4 and 1 are
                on differnt positions but are in the set.</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <span id="ps"
            >P.S: you dont know which of them is dead lol, so you just keep
            trying randomly but logically till you get it.
