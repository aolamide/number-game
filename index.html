        Dead and wounded is a game where you have to logically guess a random 4
        digit secret number generated by the computer at the beginning of the
        game. The 4-digit number is formed from 0 to 9 with each digit appearing
        only once and the first digit not being "0". Make a guess to get
        started.

        <h2 class="h2">Winning The Game:</h2>
        After you make a guess, the computer tells you how many of the numbers
        are dead(on the exact position) but doesn't tell you which of them is
        exactly and also tells you how many are wounded(in the set but not on
        the exact position). Using the information given back to you from the
        computer, you must logically guess (kill) the number in few moves as
        possible.
        <div id="example">
          Example 1:
          <ul id="example-list">
            <li>Secret number: <strong>7098</strong></li>
            <li>Your guess: <strong>7985</strong></li>
            <li>
              Response: <em>one(1) dead and two(2) wounded.</em>
              <em
                >7 is on the exact position so it's dead (one dead), while both 9 and 8 are
                in the secret number but are not in the right positions, thereby making them wounded (two wounded).</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          Example 2:
          <ul id="example-list">
            <li>Secret number: <strong>7098</strong></li>
            <li>Your guess: <strong>1234</strong></li>
            <li>
              Response: <em>zero(0) dead and zero(0) wounded.</em>
              <em
                >None of the numbers in your guess are part of the secret number, so none (0) dead and none (0) wounded.</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          Example 3:
          <ul id="example-list">
            <li>Secret number: <strong>7098</strong></li>
            <li>Your guess: <strong>7098</strong></li>
            <li>
              Response: <em>four(4) dead and zero(0) wounded.</em>
              <em
                >All numbers in the guess are in the secret number and in the right positions, so all (4) dead and none (0) wounded. You win at this point.</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div id="ps"
            >P.S: You have to figure out which numbers are dead and which are wounded by logically selecting your guesses.
